**Welcome to my HCI Portfolio!**

My name is Peiwen Zhang, a Master 1 student in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Université Paris-Saclay. This blog documents my work for the course IGD301: Human-Computer Interaction for Mixed Reality at Télécom Paris.

In this project, I explore how people interact with Virtual and Augmented Reality. You will find my lecture reflections, lab exercises like "Roll-A-Ball VR," and my final research on VR locomotion techniques. My goal is to design immersive experiences that are both easy to use and fun to play.
